# Empirical Evaluation of Speaker Adaptation on DNN based Acoustic Model

## Introduction

This is the repository of the acoustic model adaptation. Our original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10146).

In this work we give  an empirical evaluation of three typical speaker adaptation methods: Linear Input Network (LIN), Linearing Hidden Unit Contribution (LHUC) and  Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) regularization.
